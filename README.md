# Microservices Staff Webservice

This repository contains code for a RESTful webservice that I'm currently experimenting with in my free time. The webservice focuses on Staff items, and I plan to add more items in the future.

## How to Use This Repository

To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/IzzatHalabi/microservices-staff.git`

You can then navigate to the cloned directory and run the webservice using the following command:

`docker-compose up`

This will start the webservice on port 9000. You can then test the webservice using a tool like Postman or by navigating to http://localhost:9000/staff.

## Docker Hub Repository

You can also pull the Docker image for this webservice from my Docker Hub repository using the following command:

`docker pull izzathalabi/staffwebservice:1.3`
